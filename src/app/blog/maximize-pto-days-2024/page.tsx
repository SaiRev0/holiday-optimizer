        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          For most professionals, paid time off (PTO) is a precious resource that often feels too limited. 
          The average American worker receives only 10-15 paid vacation days per year, making it crucial to use them strategically. 
          This guide will show you how to maximize your PTO days in 2024 by planning them around weekends and holidays, effectively 
          turning your limited time off into extended breaks.

        <h2 id="strategic-approach">Understanding the Strategic PTO Planning Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Strategic PTO planning involves placing your vacation days adjacent to weekends and public holidays to create longer breaks 
          without using as many PTO days. This "bridging" technique can sometimes turn 3-4 PTO days into a 9-day vacation.
        </p>
        
        <Callout title="Why This Works" type="info">
          By placing your PTO days strategically around existing holidays and weekends, you can create extended breaks 
          while minimizing the actual vacation days you use from your limited allocation.

        <h2 id="planning-techniques">Planning Techniques for Maximum Effect</h2>

        <h3 id="sandwich-method">The "Sandwich" Method</h3>
        <p>
          Place your PTO days between a weekend and a holiday to "sandwich" your vacation days for maximum impact. 
          For example, taking Monday-Wednesday off when Thursday is a holiday gives you a 6-day weekend while using only 3 PTO days.
        </p>

        <h3 id="bridge-technique">The "Bridge" Technique</h3>
        <p>
          Use your PTO days to "bridge" the gap between a weekend and a holiday that falls in the middle of the week. 
          For example, with a holiday falling on Wednesday, taking Monday and Tuesday off creates a 5-day weekend with just 2 PTO days.
        </p>

        />

        <h3 id="bookend-approach">The "Bookend" Approach</h3>
        <p>
          When a holiday falls on a Monday or Friday (creating a 3-day weekend), "bookend" it by taking the remaining 4 days of the week 
          off to create a 9-day break while using only 4 PTO days.
